# Campaign Milestones

A [fundraising milestone](https://info.tiltify.com/support/solutions/articles/43000008808-adding-milestones) can be added to mark a subgoal of the total campaign progress. These can be used to mark significant amounts of progress on the fundraiser.

## Adding a Milestone

Each milestone has the following options:
- a short name that will appear in the milestone list
- an amount that should be reached for it to be satisfied.
