The compact overlay is a useful middle-ground between using the individual components to roll your own overlay and
having [the Total Package Overlay](/en/streamer-setup/overlays/presets/total/) consuming your entire allotted overlay space.

## Configuration

This component is one of the few that uses colors other than greyscale. As such, if your brand doesn't use the default blue color, [you can change it by following our docs page](/en/streamer-setup/overlays/colors/)

To remove the logo (so you can replace it with your own, non hue-shifted version using an OBS Image Source), simply add `?` to your crop-left transform.

## Implementation Notes

While we wish we could change the font size of this overlay, we unfortunately cannot - as it's not an option in
Tiltify currently. Likewise, we are unable to resize the height of this component.

However, we _can_ change the width of the component. If the community can agree on a standard width they'd like this
component to be, we can update it. However, as this component is shared with everyone in the community - we cannot
have multiple sizes.
