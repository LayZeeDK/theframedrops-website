[Donor Rewards](https://info.tiltify.com/support/solutions/articles/43000011862-adding-incentives-targets-formerly-known-as-challenges-) can be added to provide
viewers incentives to donate to the campaign. You can think of these as Twitch point reward redemptions that utilize charity
donations to activate.

> For a way to do something similar to community pooled channel point rewards Twitch provides using charity donations,
> see our page on [targets](/en/streamer-setup/tiltify/targets/).

## Adding a Reward

Each reward has the following options:

- A name for the reward
- The amount it will cost donors to recieve
- Description of what the reward will give
- Quantity of times a donor can redeem the reward - will be unable to redeem after this number (optional)
- Start and end date of redemption being abled
- Image to show as reward preview (600px x 600px)

You're also able to allow viewers to input text (similar to how you can do so with Twitch point rewards) by providing a question.

While one of the listed options is "Shipping", we will not be enabling this for our project due to complexities involving
shipping, keeping streamers accountable, and more.

To ask for a reward to be added to the campaign, send a message to [the #streamers channel in Discord](https://discord.theframedrops.com) with the above information.

### Community Note

Since we will have multiple streamers, we will need to distinguish the different rewards to distinguish "community wide" rewards and
"streamer wide" rewards. To do this, we will likely have (global) or (streamer \{\{channel name\}\}) appended (or prepended) to the name of the reward

### Apperance

Each reward is listed in the donation page and can be selected by the user.
