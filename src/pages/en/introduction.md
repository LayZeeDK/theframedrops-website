The Frame Drops is a charity livestream event aimed at raising funds for the [Cancer Research Institute](https://www.cancerresearch.org).
The Cancer Research Institute helps support immunotherapy research by funding [grants and fellowships](https://www.cancerresearch.org/scientists/cri-funding-directory) to provide crucial resources for laboratory work and clinical trials, including personnel, equipment, and supplies.

We'll be live during a weekend (TBD) in the month of November and have [some fun events scheduled](/schedule).

This event is open to everyone. If you're a streamer that would like to join us, [we'd love to have you](/streamers-setup/).
Likewise, if you're a viewer, we'd love to have you as part of a group event as participants in streams themselves!

Our goal is help others, have fun, and have good conversation to bring awareness and understanding for the causes we support.

Join us in [our Discord](https://discord.theframedrops.com) to join in on the event, participate in activities, and add to our growing
list of events.
