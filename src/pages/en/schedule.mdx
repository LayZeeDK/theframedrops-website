The next Frame Drops will be hosted throughout November 4th — 6th. Different [participating streamers](/en/streamers) will be
live at different times, but we're centered around those dates in general.

We have a calendar of events below! These times are not final, and may change closer to the day of the event — make sure to stay up to date <a href={DISCORD_URL}>in our Discord</a> for more information!

<div style="min-height: calc(72rem + 5.2rem + 3px);">
