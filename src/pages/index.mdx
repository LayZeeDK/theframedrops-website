The Frame Drops is a charity livestream event aimed at raising funds for the [Cancer Research Institute](https://www.cancerresearch.org).
The Cancer Research Institute helps support immunotherapy research by funding [grants and fellowships](https://www.cancerresearch.org/scientists/cri-funding-directory) to provide crucial resources for laboratory work and clinical trials, including personnel, equipment, and supplies.

We'll be live throughout November 4th â€” 6th and have [some fun events scheduled](/en/schedule).

This event is open to everyone. If you're a streamer that would like to join us, [we'd love to have you](/en/streamer-setup/).
Likewise, if you're a viewer, we'd love to have you as part of a group event as participants in streams themselves!

Our goal is help others, have fun, and have good conversation to bring awareness for the causes we support.

Join us in <a href={DISCORD_URL}>our Discord</a> to join in on the event, participate in activities, and add to our growing
list of events.
