The Frame Drops is a charity livestream event aimed at raising funds for [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/).
The Trevor Project helps save LGBTQ+ youth lives by providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services.

This event is open to everyone. If you're a streamer that would like to join us, [we'd love to have you](/streamers).
Likewise, if you're a viewer, we'd love to have you as part of a group event as participants in streams themselves!

Our goal is help others, have fun, and have good conversation to bring awareness and understanding for the LGBTQ+ community.

We currently do not have a set-in-stone date or set list of events (although we have lots of ideas), we'll have them soon.

Join us in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/yQrnFcKF7p) to get notified when these details are nailed down or just to chat
and hang out in preparation for the big event.
