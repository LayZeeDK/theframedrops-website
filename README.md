The Frame Drops is a charity livestream event aimed at raising funds for [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/).
The Trevor Project helps save LGBTQ+ youth lives by providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services.

[During our charity stream in September, we raised $3k+](https://tiltify.com/+the-frame-drops/giga-stream)! We're doing
a much smaller event to kick off 2022, and then a much larger one later in the year (TBD)!

This time, we'll be live on the January 1st and have [some fun events scheduled](/schedule).

This event is open to everyone. If you're a streamer that would like to join us, [we'd love to have you](/streamers-setup/).
Likewise, if you're a viewer, we'd love to have you as part of a group event as participants in streams themselves!

Our goal is help others, have fun, and have good conversation to bring awareness and understanding for the LGBTQ+ community.

Join us in [our Discord](https://discord.theframedrops.com) to join in on the event, participate in activities, and add to our growing
list of events
