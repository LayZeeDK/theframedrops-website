The Frame Drops is a charity livestream event aimed at raising funds for [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/).
The Trevor Project helps save LGBTQ+ youth lives by providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services.

We'll be live from the 25th to the 26th and have a [plethora of events scheduled](/schedule).

This event is open to everyone. If you're a streamer that would like to join us, [we'd love to have you](/streamers-setup/).
Likewise, if you're a viewer, we'd love to have you as part of a group event as participants in streams themselves!

Our goal is help others, have fun, and have good conversation to bring awareness and understanding for the LGBTQ+ community.
